@General Description    
              
	This is a Javascript and HTML5 canvas game that
	tests the a player's reaction. When the square
	turns green, the user should click as fast as 
	they can. Their reaction time is calculated
	and averaged.

@Developer Description

	**This code is meant to help beginners.
	**I advise you to check out http://elocade.com

	The program was documented and organized so that 
	learning and manipulating it is easy for anyone. 
	This game is not exactly the same as the one seen on Elocade, 
	a lot of material was cut down so it is easier to understand for beginners. 
	Furthermore, code was not optimized for maximum efficiency 
	as it would cloud my original intention, to teach. I don't mean 
	to undervalue effiency, and it is definitely crucial as you advance 
	in your development career. But for the sake of learning, I kept it simple!
	I hope this serves useful for you new developers! I look forward to seeing you 
	produce your own games. If you have any questions,suggestions, or critique 
	shoot me an email!
